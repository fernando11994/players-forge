# D.1 Inception

Group 08 – PlayersForge\
Group Members: Kylie Cook, Fernando Diaz

## 1. Introduction:

Gaming has become a global hobby that brings many people together. From competitive gaming to limitless customizability, modern games have
become diverse in content. Likewise, many communities have come together to modify their favorite games. But, such modifications or mods as
they are referred to in the gaming community are at times hard to find. PlayersForge is a service created to facilitate such issues, providing
a hub where players can more easily find mods for their favorite games, or upload their own creations. By joining our service, players will
be able to subscribe to their favorite games. Subscribing allows our system to find all the mods relevant to the game. In addition favoriting your
favorite mods will let you find similar content, updates, and store them in your library for future use. Users of the service will also be able to link
their social media accounts in order to share and promote their own mods.

user, specially those that are not fully versed in computers

### Interview 4:
**Summary:** Carson believes that a system such a PlayersForge can be useful, as long as it
features proper communication. Or features that can unite players together.  
**Interviewer:** Fernando Diaz \
**Interviewee:** Carson Posciask \
**When:** February 7, 2021\
**Consumer Segment:** Carson is a gamer, obsessed with the KFC game: I love You Colonel Sanders. As well as fps games such as Rainbow Siege Six, and Call of Duty.\
**Key Insights:**
- According to Carson, it is important to have categories to the games. Categories will make games easier to find, and will also
allow users to find different games in the same category that may appeal to them. A recommendation system can also engage users to find
new games they might like, while also giving them a list of relevant mods. 

**Assessment: Must have:N/A / Nice to have: N/A / Don’t care:**
- Must have: 
 Easy communication or team chat. \
 Flexibity across different Operating Systems, such as Linux, Windows, or MacOs.
- Nice to have:
Live chat or voice chat, not a necessity. \
Ability to link projects to different social media and professional platforms.\
Don't care:
Game Billboards. \
**Representative Quotes:**
- "I believe it would be a fun game if it was interactive, such as a live chat. Or just having voice chats for players to engange 
with each other." 
- "Although I understand the name, I believe is a bit too long. The name feels like is just oriented to a single community of 
fantasy users. Almost as if the service was tailored for people who play DnD games, rather than gamers."
